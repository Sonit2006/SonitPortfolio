            Hey there! I'm Sonit, a sophomore at UIUC double majoring in Computer Science and Astronomy. I'm really into
            software engineering, robotics, and AI research—basically anything where I can build cool stuff that pushes
            boundaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Python is my go-to language. There's something satisfying about how quickly you can go from idea to working
            prototype. I love diving into research problems and figuring out elegant solutions to complex challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading up on the latest astronomy discoveries, catching movies, playing
            badminton, or jamming on the tabla. Life's too short not to explore everything that fascinates you, right?
