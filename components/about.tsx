            Hey there! I'm Sonit, a sophomore at UIUC majoring in Computer Science and Astronomy. I'm really into
            software engineering, robotics, and AI research. Basically anything where I can build cool stuff that pushes
            boundaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Python is my home base. It’s the language I think in when I’m sketching ideas, prototyping fast, or digging into something complex. I love how expressive it is, how much you can do with a few clean lines, and how deep the ecosystem goes once you really start exploring it. A lot of my projects and research work end up there for a reason.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading up on the latest astronomy discoveries, catching movies, running
            badminton rallies in the gym, or playing tabla. Life's too short not to explore everything that fascinates you, right?
